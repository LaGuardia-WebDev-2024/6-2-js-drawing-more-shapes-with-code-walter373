## Directions 
### Step #1 - The bottom <br>
In this challenge, you'll draw a snowperson using the `ellipse()` command.        
<br>
Start off by making a circle, for the bottom of the snowperson, with an `ellipse()` command. This should be the first `ellipse()` command in your program.        
<br>
### Step #2 - The middle <br>
Now draw a second circle, for the middle of your snowperson, using another `ellipse()` command. This should be the second `ellipse()` command in your program.    
<br>
Make sure that your second circle is a little smaller than the bottom circle, and that it sits on top of the bottom circle.    
<br>
### Step #3 - The head <br>
Now draw a third circle, for the head of your snowperson, using another `ellipse()` command. This should be the third `ellipse()` command in your program.        
<br>
Make sure that your third circle is a little smaller than the middle circle, and that it sits on top of the middle circle, because that's what heads do. 
<br>
### Step #4 - Play! <br>
Add other elements to your snowmperson scene.
